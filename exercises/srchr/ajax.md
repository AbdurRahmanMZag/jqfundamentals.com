# Instructions

- When a user enters a search term, send a GET request to `/data/search.json`
  that includes a `q` parameter whose value is the search term. The response to
  this request is generated by the server, based on your query, so note that
  you won't find a `search.json` file in `/data`.
- When you receive the results, use the template at
  `/templates/people-detailed.tmpl` to display them.
- If there are no results, you should show a message indicating there are no
  results.

Note: If you're having a hard time coming up with a search term that returns
results, you can [see some example data here](http://localhost:8000/data/search/sample.json).
