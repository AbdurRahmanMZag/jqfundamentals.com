To get the most out of this site, you'll want to read the content *and* try the
various examples and exercises. Each chapter will spend a bit of time covering
a concept, and then you’ll have the chance to work on an exercise related to
the concept. Some of the exercises may seem trivial; others may be downright
daunting. In either case, there is no grade; the goal is simply to get you
comfortable working your way through problems you’ll commonly be called upon to
solve using jQuery.

## Using the built-in editor
Most pages on this site include a built-in editor where you can try out code.
This code will be run against the markup that's displayed in the box to the
right of the editor. To run the code that's in the editor, click the <i
class="icon-play"></i> button. You can reset the editor to its original state
by clicking the <i class="icon-repeat"></i> icon.

## Trying the examples
Each chapter of jQuery Fundamentals includes example code that demonstrates
the concepts being discussed. You can click on the <i
class="icon-eye-open"></i> icon in the bar above the example, and it will copy
the example to the editor at the top of the page.
